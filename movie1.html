  <p><strong>Description:</strong> Fast & Furious is a famous action movie series that focuses on fast cars,
     exciting missions, and strong friendship.
      The story follows Dominic Toretto and his team as they take on dangerous adventures around the world.</p>
  <p><strong>Why I Like It:</strong> I enjoy this movie because of the amazing car stunts, teamwork,
     and the theme of family. The characters support each other and face every challenge together.
      It’s more than just racing — it’s about trust, loyalty, and action!</p>
