  <p><strong>What is Bowling?</strong></p>
  <p>Bowling is a fun and competitive sport where players roll a heavy ball down a lane to knock over ten pins arranged in a triangle.</p>
  
  <p>The game has 10 rounds (called frames), and players aim to get a <strong>strike</strong> (all pins down in one roll) or a <strong>spare</strong> (all pins down in two rolls). The maximum score in a perfect game is 300 points!</p>
  
  <p>Bowling is a great hobby for people of all ages and is often played with friends, family, or in professional leagues.</p>
